## 1. EDA for Basic Iris Dataset

### Toy Dataset: Iris Dataset: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set]
1) 3 flowers of Iris species. [see images on wikipedia link above]
2) Petal and Sepal: http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~petersd/666/html/iris_with_labels.jpg
3) Objective: Classify a new flower as belonging to one of the 3 classes given the 4 features.
4) Importance of domain knowledge.
Why use petal and sepal dimensions as features?
Why do we not use 'color' as a feature?

## 2. EDA for Haberman Dataset.

### A short description of the dataset :
This is a case study performed back in 1960's at the at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital , on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery.

### Objective : 
To predict / classify a patient into one of the two classes of survival status after surgery , given 3 different parameters.

### Survival status :
1) Class attribute 1(Negative) : the patient survived 5 years or longer
2) Class attribute 2(Positive) : the patient died within 5 year

### Features/parameters :
Age of the patient at the time of operation(age), Year of operation(year) ,Number of positive Auxilary nodes detected (nodes) and survival status(status)
